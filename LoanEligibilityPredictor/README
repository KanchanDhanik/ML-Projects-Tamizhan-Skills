Get instant approval/rejection with confidence score!

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a loan prediction dataset containing:

Features:

Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed

ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Credit_History

Target Variable: Loan_Status (Y/N)

Dataset Source: Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset

🤖 Model Training
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (~76% Accuracy)

Preprocessing Steps:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Scaling numerical data

Model Saved As: loan_model.pkl

To retrain the model:

python
from loan_model import LoanEligibilityPredictor
predictor = LoanEligibilityPredictor()
data = predictor.load_data("loan_data.csv")
predictor.train_model(data)
