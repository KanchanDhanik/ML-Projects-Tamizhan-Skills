Overview
This is a Python application that detects emotions from text input using a pre-trained machine learning model. The app loads a trained model, vectorizer, and label encoder to classify text into different emotion categories.

Project Structure
emotion-app/
├── models/ (auto-created directory for ML artifacts)
│   ├── emotion_model.joblib - Pre-trained classification model
│   ├── label_encoder.joblib - Encodes/decodes emotion labels
│   └── vectorizer.joblib - Text vectorization component
├── merged_training.pkl - Training dataset (pickle format)
└── app.py - Main application file


Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Required Python packages (install via pip install -r requirements.txt):

scikit-learn

joblib

pandas

numpy

pickle

Installation
Clone this repository

Navigate to the project directory:cd emotiondetection

Install dependencies

Usage
Run the application:streamlit run src.py

The application will:

Load the pre-trained model and supporting files from the models/ directory

Process input text to detect emotions

Output the predicted emotion

Customization
To retrain the model with new data:

Replace merged_training.pkl with your new dataset

Modify the training code in app.py (if needed)

Run the training section to generate new model files
