Algorithm Details 🤖
The system uses user-based collaborative filtering with cosine similarity:

Creates a user-item rating matrix

Computes similarity between users using cosine similarity

Finds the 10 most similar users

Recommends movies that similar users rated highly but the target user hasn't seen

Displays top recommendations with predicted ratings

Customization Options 🛠
You can modify these parameters in the code:

Number of similar users to consider (similar_users = ...)

Number of recommendations (n_recommendations)

Similarity metric (currently cosine similarity)

Future Enhancements 🔮
Add item-based collaborative filtering

Implement matrix factorization

Include hybrid recommendation approach

Add user feedback mechanism

Deploy as a web service
